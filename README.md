# Flare FSBL

Flare is a small Apache 2.0 Licensed FSBL. It's a non-bricking light
weight bootloader designed for high reliability embedded systems.

Flare currently only supports booting U-Boot legacy images.

## Building

To build Flare configure providing the board, compiler prefix,
path to xsa (if required) and optionally a path to build tools.

```
./waf configure --tools-path=/opt/work/rtems/6/bin/ --compiler_prefix=arm-rtems6 --board=zynq7000 --xsa=~/mz7010_fmccc_2019_2/hardware/MZ7010_FMCCC_2019_2/MZ7010_FMCCC.xsa
```

After the build is configured you need to build
```
./waf
```

## Datasafe

The datasafe is a tool to pass data between Flare and the booted exe. The data is
stored in DDR memory so hard resets clear it but is usually maintained during soft
resets. 

The datasafe format is defined in `datasafe.txt`. Currently, only one format is
supported.
